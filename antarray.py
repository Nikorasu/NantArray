Rules for ant pheromone simulation within an array:
- Main array can contain: empty-0, hive-1, food-2, walls-3, 10-17 (fooding ants), 20-27 (homing ants) (to indicate direction last moved)
- Secondary array for pheromones: negative left by foodingAnts, positive by HomingAnts, both decreasing to 0 as they "evaporate"
- as they move, ants leave "pheromone" values in the corresponding spot in the pheromone array, to indicate whatever it just came from, food or hive
- ants can either be in fooding food mode (10-17), or bringing food home (20-27), and leave corresponding pheromones as they move
- ants are processed based on the 8 spaces around them in both arrays, ignoring the spot they're on, and the 3 spots "behind" the ant
- each "round" ants move onto the space of their target pheromone, with the lowest value, if multiple pheromones present
- ants cannot move into spaces already occupied by other ants, the hive, food, or walls.
- when a foodingAnt finds food, it changes to homingAnt, and homingAnts change back to foodingAnts when they find hive
- when target pheromones not detected, continue in same direction with occasional random variation +/- 1 (to avoid getting stuck in a corner)
- if only the non-targeted pheromone is present (in front), move the towards strongest of that type, to hopefully follow similar-ants
- when an ant moves onto a spot with an existing pheromone in the phero array, that value is added to the pheromone the ant would've left
